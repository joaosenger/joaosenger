Graduated in Systems Analysis and Development and postgraduate in Cloud Computing Projects. Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner, English level B2.

I work as a software developer, using Java and Python. I also have experience in architecting and implementing solutions using Amazon Web Services (AWS) services and implementing CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

Throughout my career, I have worked with several technologies: Linux, Docker, MySQL, Terraform and several AWS services, mainly focused on serverless development, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, ECS (Fargate), DynamoDB, Amazon EventBridge, Amazon S3 and IoT Core. In addition, I have experience with computing services, such as EC2, RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and with CI/CD services, such as AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild.
